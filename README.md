Go implementation of the Patience Diff algorithm.

The common diff algorithm is based on the [longest common subsequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_subsequence_problem) problem.
It is credited to [Eugene Myers](http://www.xmailserver.org/diff2.pdf), and is the default diff algorithm in Git.
While the diffs generated by this algorithm are efficient, in many cases they tend not to correspond to what humans would naturally identify.

Patience Diff also relies on computing the longest common subsequence, but the approach taken produces diffs that tend to be more human-readable.

## Example

This is an example comparing Patience Diff to the common diff algorithm (Myers).

Patience Diff
```diff
 #include <stdio.h>
 
+int fib(int n)
+{
+    if(n > 2)
+    {
+        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2);
+    }
+    return 1;
+}
+
 // Frobs foo heartily
 int frobnitz(int foo)
 {
     int i;
     for(i = 0; i < 10; i++)
     {
-        printf("Your answer is: ");
         printf("%d\n", foo);
     }
 }
 
-int fact(int n)
-{
-    if(n > 1)
-    {
-        return fact(n-1) * n;
-    }
-    return 1;
-}
- 
 int main(int argc, char **argv)
 {
-    frobnitz(fact(10));
+    frobnitz(fib(10));
 }
```

Common diff (Myers)
```diff
 #include <stdio.h>
 
-// Frobs foo heartily
-int frobnitz(int foo)
+int fib(int n)
 {
-    int i;
-    for(i = 0; i < 10; i++)
+    if(n > 2)
     {
-        printf("Your answer is: ");
-        printf("%d\n", foo);
+        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2);
     }
+    return 1;
 }
 
-int fact(int n)
+// Frobs foo heartily
+int frobnitz(int foo)
 {
-    if(n > 1)
+    int i;
+    for(i = 0; i < 10; i++)
     {
-        return fact(n-1) * n;
+        printf("%d\n", foo);
     }
-    return 1;
 }
 
 int main(int argc, char **argv)
 {
-    frobnitz(fact(10));
+    frobnitz(fib(10));
 }
```
